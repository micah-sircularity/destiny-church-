# Destiny Church - Content Management System

This project is a Content Management System (CMS) tailored for Destiny Church. It aims to streamline content creation, scheduling, and analysis, enabling the church to effectively manage its online presence and engage with its community.

## Problem Statement

This project addresses the need for a centralized and efficient platform to manage Destiny Church's digital content.  Currently, content creation, scheduling, and performance tracking may be fragmented across different tools and platforms. This CMS aims to consolidate these processes, improving workflow, consistency, and data-driven decision-making.

## Setup Instructions

This project utilizes a modern JavaScript stack, including React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and potentially other dependencies managed by npm. Follow these steps to set up the project:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd destiny-church-cms
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This command uses `npm` (Node Package Manager) to install all the necessary packages defined in `package.json`.

3.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command, defined in `package.json`, typically uses Vite to start a local development server.  The application will usually be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` or a similar address.  Check the console output for the exact URL.

## Usage Examples

Since this is the initial commit, the primary usage example is setting up the development environment and running the application locally.

1.  **Access the application:** After running `npm run dev`, open your web browser and navigate to the address provided in the console (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

2.  **Explore the initial interface:**  The initial commit likely provides a basic layout and structure.  Navigate through the different pages (Dashboard, Content Calendar, etc.) to familiarize yourself with the application's architecture.

3.  **Start developing:**  Modify the files in the `src` directory (e.g., `src/App.jsx`, `src/components/layout/Layout.jsx`) to implement new features or customize the existing ones.  Vite provides hot module replacement (HMR), so changes will be reflected in the browser automatically.

## Notable Features and Components

Based on the file structure, the project includes the following key features and components:

*   **Layout Components:**
    *   `src/components/layout/Layout.jsx`:  Provides the overall structure of the application.
    *   `src/components/layout/Header.jsx`:  The application's header, likely containing navigation and branding elements.
    *   `src/components/layout/Sidebar.jsx`:  A sidebar for navigation and quick access to different sections.

*   **Pages:**
    *   `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`:  A central dashboard providing an overview of key metrics and information.
    *   `src/pages/ContentCalendar.jsx`:  A calendar for scheduling and managing content.
    *   `src/pages/PostComposer.jsx`:  A tool for creating and editing content.
    *   `src/pages/Analytics.jsx`:  Displays analytics and performance data related to the content.
    *   `src/pages/Reporting.jsx`:  Generates reports based on the collected data.
    *   `src/pages/DataManagement.jsx`:  Provides tools for managing and organizing data.

*   **Context:**
    *   `src/context/AppContext.jsx`:  Likely uses React Context to manage application-wide state and data.

*   **Styling:**
    *   `src/index.css`:  Global CSS styles.
    *   `tailwind.config.js`:  Configuration file for Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework.

## Troubleshooting

Since this is the initial commit, troubleshooting will primarily focus on setup issues.

*   **`npm install` fails:**
    *   Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed correctly.  You can check their versions by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.
    *   Try deleting the `node_modules` folder and the `package-lock.json` file, then running `npm install` again.
    *   Check your internet connection.

*   **`npm run dev` fails:**
    *   Verify that the `dev` script in `package.json` is correctly configured to start the Vite development server.
    *   Check the console output for any error messages and search for solutions online.

*   **Application doesn't load in the browser:**
    *   Ensure the development server is running correctly (check the console output).
    *   Verify that you are accessing the correct URL in your browser.
    *   Try clearing your browser's cache.
